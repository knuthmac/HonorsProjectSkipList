        This project was super fun to build. I watched an MIT lecture to get a general understand of Skip lists and read some papers 
        to solidfy the content. I also thought the application problem was fun. I've never been to New York, but I hear the NYC subway 
        system is somewhat challenging to navigate. Coming up with an ideal path to get from point A to point B was super fun and dare 
        I say practical. I enjoyed working on this project as my curiousity grew as I learned more. Thank you for the super fun semester
        filled with valuable information both practical and interesting.
